This course provides a concise yet comprehensive introduction to data science, machine learning, deep learning, image processing, and generative AI.
It begins with the basics of AI and ML, covering types like supervised and unsupervised learning, and introduces tools such as Scikit-learn for model building. 
Python fundamentals, including data types, loops, functions, and libraries like Pandas and NumPy, are explored for data analysis. Visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn help represent data effectively. 
Deep learning is introduced through neural networks, activation functions, and optimizers. Image processing covers pixel structures, OpenCV, and Teachable Machine for building simple models like waste classification. 
Generative AI concepts such as LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and tools like ComfyUI are discussed for generating text and images. 
Throughout, the focus remains on practical applications, especially in sustainability, including smart agriculture, climate modeling, and green tech innovations.
